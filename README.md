# n0m4d's Grimoire

A collection of field notes I'll be taking as I go deeper down the cybersecurity rabbit hole. This is purely to help me understand the all the concepts here because I really won't be able to remember all of it. At least for now. 

This will constantly change and be refined as I learn new things. Hope this helps anyone who uses it.
