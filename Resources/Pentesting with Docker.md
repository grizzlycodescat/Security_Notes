# Intro

I've been looking into creating a pentesting lab for the following reasons:
- I wanted to know how these environments are set up ad how they interact with each other.
- I needed a pentesting VM that wasn't overly bloated in terms of file size. 
- Ideally, I'd have a solution where I could create fresh instances that depended on my testing targets, with a few baseline tools that I was used to having. 
I didn't really need a GUI for anything other than webapps, and there were ways to get around that as well.

I've been using VMWare to run Kali as well as other boxes but as time went on, the file size started increasing rather drastically.
